# Tensor flow JS

In this project I have use Tensor flow and Visor.
I have used Linear Regression, Non Linear Regression, Binanry Classification and Multiclass Classification to predict the results. 

# Installation
Clone this repo from following url
```sh
https://github.com/OmerChaudhry/house-price-prediction.git
```


### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **TensorFlow.js**: This project uses TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and on Node.js.
- **Visor**: Visor is a visualization tool that can be used in TensorFlow.js to monitor and visualize the training process and model performance. Ensure you have Visor integrated into your environment to make the most of its capabilities.

## Usage

### Model Types

This project demonstrates the following predictive models:

1. **Linear Regression**: A basic linear approach for predicting house prices.
2. **Non-Linear Regression**: Utilizes more complex, non-linear models to predict house prices.
3. **Binary Classification**: Classifying houses into two categories, for instance, whether a house will be sold above or below a certain price point.
4. **Multiclass Classification**: Predicting houses into multiple categories, such as price ranges or types of housing.

### Running the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the provided command to clone the repository to your local environment.
2. **Set Up Dependencies**: Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed. Use Node.js package manager to install any required packages or libraries.
3. **Explore the Models**: Navigate through the project files to explore different models implemented for house price prediction.
4. **Run and Test**: Execute the code for each model to observe how they predict house prices. You might want to adjust parameters, tune hyperparameters, or use different data for training and testing.
